    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Rigatoni are short, wide tubes of pasta with ridges on the outside and square-cut ends, a name derived from the Italian word for "ridged".
        These ridges and hollow shape excel at capturing thick sauces, meats, and large vegetables,
    </p>

        This baked rigatoni casserole, made with a flavorsome meat sauce loaded with Italian sausage, fresh herbs, and tomatoes,
         is a comforting cheesy baked pasta dish perfect for colder weather and always a crowd-pleaser!
