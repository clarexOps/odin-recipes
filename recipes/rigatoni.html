    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Rigatoni are short, wide tubes of pasta with ridges on the outside and square-cut ends, a name derived from the Italian word for "ridged".
        These ridges and hollow shape excel at capturing thick sauces, meats, and large vegetables,
    </p>
    <p>
        This baked rigatoni casserole, made with a flavorsome meat sauce loaded with Italian sausage, fresh herbs, and tomatoes,
         is a comforting cheesy baked pasta dish perfect for colder weather and always a crowd-pleaser!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 pounds mild Italian sausage links, casings removed</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans Italian-style crushed tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>2 cups of water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 ½ (16 ounce) packages rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups freshly shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>aluminum foil</li>        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
            Add onion and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes.
            Add sausage; stir to break up lumps and cook until lightly browned and crumbly, 6 to 8 minutes.
            Drain and discard grease.
        </li>

        <li>Add undrained tomatoes, water, basil, oregano,
            and parsley to the pan; bring to a boil over medium heat.
            Reduce heat to low and cook, partially covered, for 25 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes.
            Drain, rinse under cool water, and drain again.
            Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Uncover the sauce and increase heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 6 to 8 minutes.
            Remove from heat and add 2/3 of the sauce to pasta; toss to combine. Stir in mozzarella cheese and 1 cup Parmesan cheese. 
            Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish, pour remaining sauce over top, and cover with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with remaining Parmesan, 
            and bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes longer.
        </li>
    </ol>
