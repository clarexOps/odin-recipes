    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti pie is a baked dish with a spaghetti noodle "crust" filled with layers of meat sauce, cottage cheese or ricotta, and mozzarella cheese, 
        all baked together like a casserole or lasagna but in a pie pan. 
        It's a comfort food that combines Italian flavors into a convenient and sliceable format, making it perfect for weeknight dinners or feeding a crowd.
