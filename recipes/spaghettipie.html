        <li>1 (6 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch pie plate with 1 tablespoon butter.</li>

        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
            Drain spaghetti through a colander and return to the pot.
        </li>

        <li>
            Stir Parmesan cheese, beaten eggs, and 2 tablespoons butter into hot spaghetti until well combined.
            Form spaghetti mixture into a crust in the prepared pie plate and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, bell pepper, and 
            garlic in the hot skillet until beef is crumbly and browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
            Drain off fat and stir in undrained tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, and oregano.
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through.
        </li>

        <li>Spread cottage cheese over spaghetti crust, then pour in beef-tomato mixture.</li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the top of pie and
            continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.
        </li>
    </ol>
